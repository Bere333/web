All of the marquee tournaments around the world (including those played at the World Series of Poker, the World Poker Tour, the European Poker Tour, and elsewhere) feature the no-limit variation of this game. In fact, Texas hold’em is so popular some who aren’t familiar with poker don’t realize there are other ways to play the game.",
//         "ho102learningـhowـtoـplayـtexasـhol": "Learning how to play Texas hold’em poker is not that difficult, but don’t let the simplicity of the game mislead you. The number of possible game situations is so vast that the game can be very complex, when playing at a high level. That’s the inspiration for the famous saying about Texas hold’em that “it takes a moment to learn, but a lifetime to master.”",

In this respect, hold’em is not unlike other poker games like five-card draw. However, the way players construct their hands in Texas hold’em is a little different than in draw poker.",
//         "ho106inـholdemـeachـplayerـisـdeal": "In hold’em each player is dealt two cards face down (the “hole cards”), then over the course of subsequent rounds five more cards are eventually dealt face up in the middle of the table. These face up cards are called the “community cards” because each player uses them to make a five-card poker hand.",
//         "ho107theـfiveـcommunityـcardsـareـd": "The five community cards are dealt in three stages. The first three community cards are called the “flop.” Then just one card is dealt, called the “turn.” Finally one more card, the fifth and final community card is dealt — the “river.”",
//         "ho108playersـconstructـtheirـfive_c": "Players construct their five-card poker hands using the best available five cards out of the seven total cards (the two hole cards and the five community cards). This can be done by using both of the hole cards in combination with three community cards, one hole card in combination with four community cardsm or no hole cards and playing all five community cards — whatever works to make the best five-card hand.",
//         "ho109ifـtheـbettingـcausesـallـbut": "If the betting causes all but one player to fold, the lone remaining player wins the pot without having to show any cards. For that reason, players don’t always have to hold the best hand to win the pot. It’s always possible a player can “bluff” and get others to fold better hands. If two or more players make it all the way to the showdown after the last community card is dealt and all betting is complete, then the only way to win the pot is to have the highest-ranking five-card poker hand.",
//         "ho110letsـgetـintoـsomeـspecifics": "Let’s get into some specifics including how to deal Texas hold’em and how the betting works.

//         "ho112playـmovesـclockwiseـaroundـth": "Play moves clockwise around the table, starting with action to the left of the dealer button. The button is a round disc that sits in front of a player and is rotated one seat to the left every hand. When playing in casinos and poker rooms, the player with the dealer button doesn’t actually deal the cards (the poker room hires someone to do that). In home games with friends, though, the player with the button usually does deal the hands.",
//         "ho113generallyـtheـfirstـtwoـplayer": "Generally, the first two players sitting to the immediate left of the button are required to post a small blind and a big blind to initiate the betting. From there, action occurs on multiple streets: preflop, the flop, the turn and the river (explained further below).",
//         "ho114theـbuttonـdeterminesـwhichـpl": "The button determines which player at the table is the acting dealer. In Texas hold’em, the player on the button, or last active player closest to the button, receives last action on all postflop streets of play.",
//         "ho115whileـtheـdealerـbuttonـdictat": "While the dealer button dictates which players have to post the small and big blinds, it also determines where the dealing of the cards begins. The player to the immediate left of the dealer button in the small blind receives the first card and then the dealer pitches cards around the table in a clockwise motion from player to player until each has received two starting cards.",
//         "ho116theـblinds": "The Blinds",
//         "ho117asـmentionedـbeforeـeveryـnew": "As mentioned, before every new hand, two players at the table are obligated to post small and big blinds. These are forced bets that begin the wagering. Without these blinds, the game would be very boring because no one would be required to put any money into the pot. Players could just wait around until they are dealt pocket aces and only play then. The blinds, however, ensure there will be “action” on every hand.",
//         "ho118inـtournamentsـtheـblindsـare": "In tournaments, the blinds are raised at regular intervals. As the number of players keeps decreasing and the stacks of the remaining players keep getting bigger, it is a necessity that the blinds keep increasing throughout a tournament. In cash games, the blinds always stay the same.",
//         "ho119theـplayerـdirectlyـtoـtheـlef": "The player directly to the left of the button posts the small blind, and the player to his or her direct left posts the big blind. The small blind is generally half the amount of the big blind, although this stipulation varies from room to room and can also be dependent on the game being played. For example, in a “$1\/$2” game of Texas hold’em, the small blind is $1 and the big blind is $2.",

//         "ho126theـamountـaـplayerـcanـraise": "The amount a player can raise to depends on the game that is being played. Most commonly in a game of no-limit Texas hold’em, the minimum opening raise must be at least twice the big blind, and the maximum raise can be all of the chips a player has in his or her stack (an “all-in” bet).",
//         "ho127thereـareـotherـbettingـvariat": "There are other betting variations in hold’em poker. In fixed-limit hold’em (or just “limit hold’em), a raise is always exactly twice the big blind. In pot-limit hold’em (played much less often than the other variations), players can bet anywhere from the amount of the big blind (the minimum bet allowed) up to the total amount in the current pot.",
//         "ho128afterـtheـfirstـplayerـunder": "After the first player (“under the gun”) acts, play proceeds in a clockwise fashion around the table with each player also having the same three options — to call, raise, or fold.

Along with the options to bet, call, fold, or raise, a player now has the option to “check” if no betting action has occurred beforehand. A check simply means to pass the action to the next player in the hand.",

In Omaha, players must use exactly two of their hole cards and three of the community cards to build a poker hand. That’s different from hold’em where players can use both of their hole cards (and three community cards), just one hole card (and four community cards), or no hole cards (and all five community cards, which is called “playing the board”).",

Anyone with KxKxXxXx or QxQxXxXx would have a higher set, and an opponent with Jx10xXxXx would have made a straight.

Many consider it to be even more important, both because of the pot-limit betting format and because of all the possible combinations a player can make with an Omaha hand. When sitting in position, you can follow the actions of your opponents and make your decisions based on the information you received. When out of position, it is much harder to make the correct decisions because you are dealing with incomplete information more often.",
//         "om195anotherـbenefitـofـbeingـinـpo": "Another benefit of being in position is that you have a better chance of controlling the size of the pot, which is often based on the strength of your hand and your overall goal in the pot. Being out of position to one or more opponents gives them the ability to control the pot size and also capitalize on the added information of knowing your actions first.",
//         "om196becauseـomahaـisـsoـfocusedـon": "Because Omaha is so focused on the nuts, it might seem like bluffing plays an important role in the game. A player can represent a wider range of hands in Omaha, and also open up with a bit more with so many more semi-bluffs available. In fact, experienced Omaha players will often bet big draws heavily on the flop, since in some cases those draws are actually mathematical favorites versus made hands.",
//         "om197allـofـwhichـisـtoـsayـplayers": "All of which is to say players do bluff in pot-limit Omaha, but with so many possible hands out there you have to be judicious when deciding when it is best to bluff. The more you learn about the game, the easier it will become to pick up on these spots and determine how to proceed against various opponents.",
//         "om198relatedlyـblockersـalsoـbecome": "Relatedly, blockers also become much more prevalent in Omaha than in Texas hold’em. Blockers are those cards you hold in your hand that prevent an opponent from making a specific hand.",
//         "om199forـexampleـifـaـboardـreadsـk": "For example, if a board reads K♠10♠5♥2♠4♦ and you hold the A♠ in your hand but no other spades, you may not have a flush, but you know your opponent cannot make the nut flush. This gives you added power in the hand being able to push your opponent off certain hands as your opponent is guaranteed to not contain the nuts.",

//         "raz111eachـplayerـwantingـtoـbeـdeal": "Each player wanting to be dealt in to receive a hand would have to post the $1 ante, creating a pot worth competing for. The first three cards are then dealt to each player before it is determined that one player must post the bring-in. Whereas in seven-card stud the player with the lowest-ranking door card must post the $5 bring-in, in razz it’s the opposite — the player with the highest door card must pay the bring-in, with the Kx being the highest-ranking card in the game.",

Also worth noting — pairs count in razz, making hands undesirably higher. That means any starting hand that has a pair is a bad one, and that pairing up on subsequent rounds is also detrimental to players making strong razz hands.",

That player should complete even with those face cards in the hole, because the player with the queen showing will very likely be unable to call and continue in the hand. Stealing the antes and bring-ins is a key component of solid razz strategy.",
//         "raz120fromـthereـrazzـstrategyـinvol": "From there razz strategy involves understanding when it is worth continuing to draw to a strong low hand as well as keeping track of opponent’s up cards to know which cards have been used and which remain as “outs” with which to complete a hand. Sometimes even a good starting hand like 7x3x2x becomes less attractive if several fours, fives, and sixes are showing up as other players’ up cards, thus making it harder for you to draw to that 7-low.",
//         "raz121inـrazzـplayersـwithـlowـcards": "In razz players with low cards showing as their up cards often will be aggressive with their betting and raising, although sometimes it can be correct to bet and raise with an especially strong draw that is concealed by the fact that your lower cards are face down.",

Say on sixth street you have 4♦2♥ \/ 3♣A♠K♥6♠ and you see your opponent with XxXx \/ 5♣6♠J♦7♣. You know that whatever card your opponent ends up drawing on seventh street, the very best that player can make will be 6-5-3-2-A, a hand you already have beaten with your current 6-4-3-2-A.",

//         "satellite105asـinـsevencardـstudـinـrazz": "As in seven-card stud, in razz a player will decide on the basis of these first three cards whether or not to continue in the hand, with starting hand selection again being a key element of the game’s strategy.",
//         "satellite106eachـplayerـwhoـdoesntـfoldـp": "Each player who doesn’t fold prior to seventh street eventually will be dealt a total of seven cards — the first two down and one up, then three more up, then the last card down. From these seven cards the player has to make the best possible five-card combination, only instead of making a high hand the player is trying to make the lowest possible hand with the ace always counting as the lowest ranking card.",
//         "satellite107flushesـandـstraightsـdontـco": "Flushes and straights don’t count in razz, meaning the best possible razz hand is 5x4x3x2xAx with suits being entirely inconsequential. The second best hand is 6x4x3x2xAx, the third best is 6x5x3x2xAx, and so forth following the same procedure used for ranking low hands in other “lowball” or split-pot games.",
//         "satellite108alsoـthereـisـnoـeightorbet": "Also there is no “eight-or-better” qualifier in razz — the lowest hand at showdown wins, regardless how low it is.",
//         "satellite109antesـbringinـandـbetting": "Antes, bring-in and betting",
//         "satellite110asـinـsevencardـstudـantesـan": "As in seven-card stud, antes and bring-in bets are employed in razz in order to stimulate action. We’ll use the example of a $10\/$20 razz game with an ante of $1 and a bring-in of $5. (Like most stud games, razz is most typically played as a fixed-limit betting game.)",
//         "satellite111eachـplayerـwantingـtoـbeـdeal": "Each player wanting to be dealt in to receive a hand would have to post the $1 ante, creating a pot worth competing for. The first three cards are then dealt to each player before it is determined that one player must post the bring-in. Whereas in seven-card stud the player with the lowest-ranking door card must post the $5 bring-in, in razz it’s the opposite — the player with the highest door card must pay the bring-in, with the Kx being the highest-ranking card in the game.",
//         "satellite112ifـmultipleـplayersـhaveـaـkin": "If multiple players have a king showing on third street, this becomes the only instance in razz where suits matter, with the player having the highest ranking king being the one forced to post the bring-in according to the following ranking: K♠ (highest), K♥ (next highest), K♦ (third highest), and K♣ (lowest).",
//         "satellite113asـinـsevencardـstudـtheـplay": "As in seven-card stud, the player posting the bring-in has an option to “complete” the bet to $10 (the small limit of the game). From there betting clockwise around the table, with each player having the option to call, raise, or fold. Once the betting is complete, every player left in the hand is dealt a fourth card (i.e., “fourth street”).",
//         "satellite114inـsevencardـstudـtheـfirstـp": "In seven-card stud, the first player to act from fourth street on is the player displaying the highest-ranking hand. Meanwhile in razz the first player to act on fourth street and on subsequent rounds is the one with the lowest hand showing.",
//         "satellite115inـaـ1020ـrazzـgameـtheـlimits": "In a $10\/$20 razz game, the limits of betting on third and fourth street would be the smaller limit, or $10, then on fifth, sixth and seventh streets the limits would increase to $20.",
//         "satellite116strategy": "Strategy",
//         "satellite117theـbestـstartingـhandـinـrazz": "The best starting hand in razz, then, would be Ax2x3x. Often in full-ring razz games (i.e., with eight players), experienced razz players will fold three-card starting hands containing any card higher than an 8x. Also worth noting — pairs count in razz, making hands undesirably higher. That means any starting hand that has a pair is a bad one, and that pairing up on subsequent rounds is also detrimental to players making strong razz hands.",
//         "satellite118thatـsaidـitـwillـoftenـhappen": "That said, it will often happen that a table might fold around to the player sitting to the left of the one who was forced to post the bring-in with a high card showing. In that case, a player will want to complete the bet with what will necessarily be a lower door card showing, a move which will often win the antes and bring-in.",
//         "satellite119sayـaـplayerـshowingـtheـqpo": "Say a player showing the Q♦ posts the bring-in and it folds around to the last player who has K♠J♥ in the hole and the 7♥ showing. That player should complete even with those face cards in the hole, because the player with the queen showing will very likely be unable to call and continue in the hand. Stealing the antes and bring-ins is a key component of solid razz strategy.",
//         "satellite120fromـthereـrazzـstrategyـinvol": "From there razz strategy involves understanding when it is worth continuing to draw to a strong low hand as well as keeping track of opponent’s up cards to know which cards have been used and which remain as “outs” with which to complete a hand. Sometimes even a good starting hand like 7x3x2x becomes less attractive if several fours, fives, and sixes are showing up as other players’ up cards, thus making it harder for you to draw to that 7-low.",
//         "satellite121inـrazzـplayersـwithـlowـcards": "In razz players with low cards showing as their up cards often will be aggressive with their betting and raising, although sometimes it can be correct to bet and raise with an especially strong draw that is concealed by the fact that your lower cards are face down.",
//         "satellite122itـisـpossibleـsometimesـinـra": "It is possible sometimes in razz to have a “lock” on a hand where you know with certainty your opponent cannot draw to a better hand than yours. Say on sixth street you have 4♦2♥ \/ 3♣A♠K♥6♠ and you see your opponent with XxXx \/ 5♣6♠J♦7♣. You know that whatever card your opponent ends up drawing on seventh street, the very best that player can make will be 6-5-3-2-A, a hand you already have beaten with your current 6-4-3-2-A.",
//         "satellite123conclusion": "Conclusion",
//         "satellite124whileـnotـeveryoneـfindsـrazz": "While not everyone finds razz the most exciting poker variant, it is a favorite game among many, and definitely worth learning how to play. Often in H.O.R.S.E. games razz is one of the lesser known variants in the mix, meaning just a little bit of study can make you considerably better at the game than your opponents, thus potentially making the razz round a profitable one for you.",

//         "st102theـgameـcanـbeـplayedـwithـtw": "The game can be played with two to eight players, and the biggest difference between seven-card stud and Texas hold’em or Omaha is that seven-card stud does not involved a flop, and in most cases, it doesn’t involve community cards at all.",
//         "st103gameـplay": "Game Play",
//         "st104asـyouـcanـseeـinـtheـimageـab": "As you can see in the image above, to begin each hand a player is dealt the first two cards face down and then a third facing up. This is often called third street. The two face-down cards are called the “hole cards” and the face-up card is called the “door card.” Based on these three cards, one would decide whether or not to continue with the hand. Like in any poker variation, starting-hand selection is extremely important in seven-card stud.",
//         "st105eachـplayerـgetsـdealtـaـtotal": "Each player gets dealt a total of seven cards, of which three are dealt face down and four are dealt face up. From these seven cards the player has to choose his best five-card combination. The hand rankings are identical to those in Texas hold’em or Omaha; a royal flush is the best possible hand and the worst hand is the high card hand (no pair).",

//         "st107whileـtheـblindsـareـtheـforce": "While the blinds are the forced bets in Texas hold’em and Omaha poker, antes are the forced bets placed by every player before receiving any cards. As an example, let’s think of a $10\/$20 seven-card stud game with an ante of $1 and a bring-in of $5.",
//         "st108eachـplayerـwantingـtoـbeـdeal": "Each player wanting to be dealt in to receive a hand would have to post the $1 ante, creating a pot worth competing for. The first three cards are then dealt to each player before it is determined that one player must post the bring-in. In seven-card stud, the player with the lowest-ranking door card would have to post the $5 bring-in at minimum, but this person does have the option to “complete” the bet by posting $10 (the small limit of the game). From there, the betting continues clockwise around the table, with each player having the option to call, raise or fold. In the case that the first player who brought in only posts the bring-in, other players may have the option of completing the bet to $10 as the first raise. Once the betting is complete, every player left in the hand is dealt a fourth card, referred to as fourth street.",
//         "st109inـgamesـthatـinvolveـaـbutton": "In games that involve a button that dictates where the action starts, those differ from seven-card stud. In seven-card stud, the first player to act from fourth street on is the player displaying the highest-ranking hand.",
//         "st110beforeـproceedingـpastـthirdـs": "Before proceeding past third street, though, it is important to have solid hand selection. An example of good starting hands in seven-card stud would include the following:",
//         "st111sevencardـstudـisـmostـoften": "Seven-card stud is most often played as a limit game. Sticking with the same example of our $10\/$20 seven-card stud game, the limits of betting on third and fourth street would be the smaller limit, or $10 in this case. On fifth, sixth and seventh street, the limits increase to $20.",
//         "st112inـtheـcaseـthatـaـplayerـpair": "In the case that a player pairs his door card on fourth street, the opening player now has the option to bet double the small limit, or the larger limit. For example, if a player begins with an ace and picks up another ace on fourth street, that player may open with a bet of $20 instead of $10. This unique betting rule only takes place in the high version of seven-card stud, and not the split-pot version.",

//         "st114inـsevencardـstudـitـisـvery": "In seven-card stud, it is very important to pay close attention to the cards of your opponents. If you, for example, have a straight draw with K♣Q♦J♥10♠, but you already see three aces on the table, then you are only drawing to one ace and the remaining nines in the deck. If a player folded the case ace and you are unaware he or she did so, you could be incorrectly estimating your odds in the hand.",
